# Gesture-Based-Media-Controller through Mediapipe

A Python-based application that allows users to control media player functions (Play, Pause, Volume Up, Volume Down, etc.) using hand gestures detected through the webcam.  This project uses MediaPipe and OpenCV for real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition, providing a hands-free, interactive experience for media control.
